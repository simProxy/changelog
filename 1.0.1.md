# Changelog for simProxy v1.0.1
- ### New command added: /forcereconnect
This command is going to forcefully reconnect the proxy, no matter if a player is connected or if the proxy is connected, it will reconnect it.
Made mostly for the cases when the proxy is lagging somehow and stops posting messages in the chat channel and stops responding generally, though pretends to be online.

- ### New command added: /disconnect
This command is made to disconnect the proxy when it's online, though I do not really know why would you do it, but just in case if you wanna do so - it's here.

- ### New feature added: changelog
Um, does this need to have an explanation? You're reading this new feature right now. Also can be gathered in discord with /changelog.
